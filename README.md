## Features

- ### Backend

  - CRUD operations for conversations with LLM.
  - Send prompt queries and receive response from the LLM.
  - Efficiently handle multiple conversations by storing and retrieving them from a MongoDB database
  - All prompts sent to the LLM and the responses received are anonymized and securely stored in the MongoDB database.
  - **NOTE**: The OpenAI API is currently not fully integrated with the backend due to issues with authorizing the credit payment required for using the API. As a result, direct LLM interactions may be simulated or mocked for testing purposes.

- ### Frontend

  - Clean and modern UI design powered by Mantine UI, enhancing user experience through consistent styling and interactive components.
  - Display a dynamic list of all conversations retrieved from the backend, allowing users to quickly access and manage their past interactions with the LLM.
  - Chat interface inspired by popular AI chat platforms, enabling users to send messages to the LLM and view responses in real time.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, Next.js, React, Mantine UI, React Query
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Beanie (MongoDB ODM), Pydantic, OpenAI API
- **Database**: MongoDB
